Along with this file, you will find a Windows self-extracting ZIP file
(extension of EXE). You run the Zip file as you would any other Windows
program: double-click on it or execute it by typing the filename.  There is
a READ.ME file included in the data that gives you further instructions
once the data is un-Zipped. If you have any problems extracting the data,
please contact the person who gave you this diskette.  For questions about
the course data, please direct your questions to the instructor of the
course.
